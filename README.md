# TFG---Development-of-an-intelligent-agent-based-on-neural-networks
n this End of Degree Project the aim has been to create an intelligent enemy capable of reacting to the movements of a fighting video-games expert and to analyze how satisfactory our enemies learning has been. To be more precise, we have implemented an AI using neural networks and the Unity engine, employing the help of real players input sets and randomly generated data provided by hours of fighting against another AI. For a better implementation of the AI, it was necessary to create a game from scratch using Unity. The project has been implemented using Unity, which employs C# language scripts to control the elements of the game. Key words: Intelligent enemies, fighting game, fight game, neural network, Artificial Intelligence, videogame made with unity, fight, AI.
